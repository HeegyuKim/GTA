These are negative reviews.

ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. This store is such a joke. I've shopped at Best Buy before... not for any major purchases, usually just for CDs or DVDs, never had any problems until now.

They are soooooo slow every time we go to the drive through window. We have decided to change pharmacies.
===
Horrible beer, horrible service, horrible menu
===
He was incredibly sexist/homophobic. He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls.
===
Slow service. Below average food .Ill pass
===
Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. I want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run around.
===
Servers are chatting, not paying attention to tables. I can see my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever.
===
The food was okay. The noise level--with 10 people in a huge room--deafening. Awful acoustics!
===
Really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour. No one wants to pay $8 for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality.
===
I had a gift card so I decided to use it for a to go order. The food tasted frozen and microwaved. Nothing special just around average!
